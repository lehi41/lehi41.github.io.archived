To help your household---and even our ward family---take the teachings of Moses 7 to heart, the Sunday School presidency invites you to participate in 2 activities.\n       - ACTIVITY 1 - As a household, take turns asking each other fun and creative get-to-know-you questions as part of your FHE/Come Follow Me activity. This can be done at the dinner table or even on the go---just make sure you're all together giving each other your undivided attention.\n       - Not sure what to ask? Feel free to use some of the example questions from this article: https://www.thedad.com/family-questions-game/\n       - Don't have anyone else in your household to ask? Feel free to text a question to a loved one, friend, or even someone to whom you minister. I'm sure they'd love to hear from you.\n       - ACTIVITY 2 - Read the get-to-know-you question in the attached picture and share your and/or your family's answers in the comments below. Family friendly-GIFs are welcomed. If you could eat one food for the rest of your life, what would it be?\n      Lastly, be sure to have fun. You might be surprised by the new and interesting things you'll learn about each other as you strive to be more like the people of Zion."},{title:"Tuesday - Lehi 41st Ward Conference week",date:new Date(2022,0,25).toUTCString(),description:"<ul> <li>Mount Timpanogos Temple Night</li> <li>Family History and/or Temple rep to organize activity for Ward</li></ul>"},{title:"Wednesday - Lehi 41st Ward Conference week",date:new Date(2022,0,26).toUTCString(),description:""},{title:"Thursday - Lehi 41st Ward Conference week",date:new Date(2022,0,27).toUTCString(),description:"7:00am\u20139:30am: Utah Food Bank Service Project.
