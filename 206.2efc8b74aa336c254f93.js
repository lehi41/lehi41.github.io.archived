Feel free to use some of the example questions from this article: https://www.thedad.com/family-questions-game/</li>\n        <li>Don't have anyone else in your household to ask? Feel free to text a question to a loved one, friend, or even someone to whom you minister. I'm sure they'd love to hear from you.</li>\n        <li>ACTIVITY 2 - Read the get-to-know-you question in the attached picture and share your and/or your family's answers in the comments below.
